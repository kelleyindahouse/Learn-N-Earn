<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://gyazo.com/da658b3b20ace8d71a02d37ef5b26170)

Learn-n-Earn is a project that unifies Employers and job hungry college students in a middle ground that supplies publicity by filtering which college the student is attending, and then retrieving nearby gigs to the college town that the employers have posted. Learn-n-Earn is a platform where Employers can post job listings that would be perfect to a university student who is looking to make some extra cash without having to commit to a full time job. Some of Learn-n-Earn's filtered gig like tasks include Yard Work, Helping someone move, Hired Shopping, Furniture Assembly, Cleaning, Errands, and Delivery.

Here's why:
* Employers are looking for some extra hands with certain tasks that a college student is willing to work
* Students that have a lot on their plate with classes are looking for some short gig like jobs where the student can choose to work at times that meet their busy schedules.

Once posted, students will be able to interact with the post by replying to the post with comments or questions, and if they are a fit then they will apply for the gig. You will receive a short summary of the students and determine if they are right for the job.
